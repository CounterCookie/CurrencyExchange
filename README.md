# CurrencyExchange V1.0

Welcome to my first ever side project that I completed using Java. This uses the command line where the user enters there type of currency they have, what they want to convert to, and the amount of money they wish to exchange.
The program will then display the exchange rate and then calculate the amount they will recieve based on their input amount.

If the currency doesn't exist, then it will display and error and the user will have to run the program again.

This is a quick project done using Yahoo's YQL feature. Although the currency's aren't accurate as it's using Yahoo's database and it's free, it displays almost the same amount of money if you were to google exchange rates



I've have always been curious how currency exchange works and wanted to develope my own application. It was initally hard to start because this is using live data that constantly needed to be updated since currency does change every second. I stumbled upon a stackoverflow post that referenced Yahoo's YQL feature to get a whole bunch of currencies at once in XML file. Once I figured out how to read XML's from a website, everything was a breeze.

I will continue working on building a web application for it and then eventually building a andriod application for it
